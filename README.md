_CartPole Environement Problem_

Proposed Problem: How to balance a stick without it falling by moving to the left or right. Refer to Figure in Issues->Images
Cross Entropy Method applied on this problem, results of the RL model can be found underneath issues->images

_FrozenLake Environment Problem_

Outline of problem:
Agent lives in a grid of size 4 x 4 and can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right

Proposed Problem:
Agent always starts at top-left position and its goal is to reach the bottom-right cell of the grid. (See Figure 4 for details)
There are holes in the fixed cells of the grid and if agent falls into these holes, the episode ends
If the agent reaches the destination cell then it an reward of 1.0 and the episode ends.
The world is slippery, so agent's actions are unexpected
